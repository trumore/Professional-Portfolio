# Professional-Portfolio

The motivation behind the creation of this project was to create a responsive portfolio. The intent being to create a jumping off point that will include both personal and professional information so that it may continuously be added to and changed as my expertise in coding evolves and I can include more detailed projects which I have built.

The page not only contains personal information about me, but also professional information to also include functioning links to projects I have completed, along with my Github page.
